      Motion sensor analysis to predict risk of fall for elderly people.<br>
      Measuring and monitoring activity and sleep pattern. I published a paper that to my full surprise it attracted a massive media cover.<br> 
      Measuring Heart Rate using camera's of smartphones <br> 
      Measuring Breathing Rate using camera. <br> 
      Image analysis applied to wound assessment
      The ability to monitor patients and prevent patient emergencies before they occur, by analysing data for key indicators
      To deliver the above projects, we are using deep learning techniques deep convolutional neural networks and  sophisticated machine learning technique plus signal processing. For instance we have to find face landmark, eye gaze, etc that one needs sophisticated techniques plus a proper infrastructure, pipeline as the data size is big.

      Cross smile modelling for Hybrid FX products
      Research of arbitrage on the smile of cross FX
      The companyâ€™s main model is LGMSV 3F, which is the most expensive pricer. A gain in speed was critical. At first, I tried to amend the Monte Carlo using different methods but I felt that I could only achieve a maximum improvement of 20%. Then after realizing that I could use GPU, I re-implemented the Monte Carlo and achieved speeds of up to 6 times faster. I applied the same approach to the calibration procedure. I believe that we can go further and have a pricer that is 10 times faster.
      SLV model for long-term-FX. In this model  the domestic rate and foreign rate are both stochastic with one factor and FX has a volatility which is a mixture of local vol and stochastic vol. I applied a completely different numerical method that reduce the calibration time by a factor of 5 to 7.
      I worked on the calibration of HLV model (max 20s to calibrate 30 years) in which the FX has a volatility that is a mixture of Heston and Local vol, with deterministic rates. I implemented a hybrid model, where the rate could be stochastic and the FX or asset has pure local vol.}
