# Profile
profile: |
  Before joining Medopad I was their advisor for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to be applied in Healthcare. I joined Huma to build their research and development team that delivers quantitative
  tools and functionalities to help monitor patients remotely. My first focus is using advances Machine
  Learning and Artificial techniques to find signals that can help diagnose earlier the deterioration of the
  patient. Please check in academic achievements. Prior to Huma , I worked at BAML, where I not
  only helped to validate the algorithmic models of trading in the entire business, but I also helped them
  to build a ML (Machine Learning Model) for execution business. The rest of my career I worked for
  BNP and I covered different business in Fixed Income Department, I started as hybrid interest rate
  quant and then I developed quantitative trading strategy for Credit Prop desk (the most successful
  trading desk of BNP) because of Volcker Rule those activities were closed and ultimately I worked
  as a Quantitative FX high frequency market maker. I was responsible for automated pricing (mid
  discovery and prediction) and auto-hedging algorithms. My focus was on trading signal generation,
  market micro-structure, auto-hedging, pricing engines, market making and hedging strategies.My healthcare experience is purely AI and engineering.
