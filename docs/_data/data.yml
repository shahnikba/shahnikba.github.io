# Profile
profile: |
  I joined Huma, in the Spring of 2018, to build their research and development team, the goal is to deliver quantitative tools and functionalities 
  to help monitor patients remotely. My mission is to implement Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to find signals that can help 
  diagnose the deterioration of the patient earlier. Before joining Huma, I worked at BAML, where, with my team, I succeed to validate the algorithmic 
  models of trading across the entire business and build a Machine Learning Model for the execution business. Before joining BAML, I was at BNP. 
  I started as a hybrid interest rate quant and then developed a quantitative trading strategy for the Credit Prop desk (BNP's most successful trading desk). 
  Due to the Volcker Rule, those activities were closed, and I ultimately worked as a quantitative FX high-frequency market maker where 
  I was responsible for automated pricing (mid-discovery and prediction) and auto-hedging algorithms. My focus was on generating trading signals, 
  market microstructure, auto-hedging, pricing engines, market making, and hedging strategies.
