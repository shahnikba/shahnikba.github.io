# Who am I?
I am an applied mathematician, working  in two area Finance and Healthcare. Most of my time nowadays is spent on research. Thinking about my typical working day, I can only give an example as most days are different.

I am an early bird, waking up at 6am. This time in the morning is my time. When everything else is quiet, (not very true these days as my 5 years old son is also an early bird). I do some reading or go in front of my PC, and I do some development, working on a research paper or reading up on something I want to learn more about. These few hours in the morning are very critical for me because it gives me a good start into the rest of the day or even week.
After that depending to my company (Finance or Healthcare) I would have different typical days.

## Finance:(Algorithmic trading)
Working in automated high frequency market making, you are at the interface of computer science, AI/ML, mathematics and Economics. As it is quite difficult to work on all the aspects of the market making, our work is highly collaborative between a small team of quant traders (myself) and quant developers (again myself) and also talking to Economists and Strategist to have an idea the Economical events and announces. 

We rarely need meeting, as we sit close together and discuss every issue and anything we do, in a continious rythm, we go together for lunch (one buys for everyone). We start the day early 8am and finish quite late up to 8pm if not longer. 

The concept of an autmated HF market making is quite simple you have 
a set of trading strategies that involve placing a limit order to sell (or offer) or a buy limit order (or bid) in order to earn the bid-ask spread. By doing so, we provide liqiiduty to incoming market orders. I love this job, providing liquidity to the market is an incredibly important contribution one can do to the society, just imagine that with your debit card you can travel anywhere in the world and take cash out in their local currency or you can buy whatever on Amazon. This is only possible thanks to our works and those in other banks. Clearly there is a competetion in this area that one cannot avoid, everyone wants to show a better price and attract more clients which ends up in ultra low latency race.

Some typical works I do is, backtesting a new strategy, analysing our live trading stategies live and also in the past days, try to understand what went well and what didn't go as we expected. I might discover that we miss some good trades due to a delay (here we talk about mille seconds or less), it is one of my favourit moment to fix discover the problem and find the solution to fix it. Being able to predict the fluctuation of the next price movement (next could one mili second ot few seconds) is very crutial, we spend a good amount of our time to build a model that can predict the direction of the market in real time. Oh, my god, it is not easy, we are talking about a massive amount data, plus you need to make all computations as quick as possible, if you are supposed to predict the price in 10 mili seconds, you can't easily use a massive complex model that would need more time to calculate it.

I love this job, as opposed to a lot of data science or AI/ML job you cannot bulshit with fancy models and presentations or papers, your model or any improment you claim to do a fantstic jon can be assessed in real practice. But having said that, one always need cutting edge knowledhe in computer science and apllied mathematics (includes AI, ML, statisics and the rest).



## Digitial Healthcare:(Remote patient monitoring)

Working at the interface of AI/ML and healthcare, most of my work is collaborative, with other AI/ML enginneers or with researchers from clinical background. I have many interdisciplinary collaborations with clinicians, software developers and AI researcher on healthcare topics.

At 9am I have my first standup meeting. Today, I am meeting with our bigger team in the all-in-one cradiovauscular project, where we design an automated platform to track digital biomarkers from users and try to give a feedback on their risk of any cardiovascular event. This is a close collaboration between AI researcher and clinicians which I truly enjoy as this interdisciplinary approach is so much more than its individual components.

Then at 10am I have a meeting with a research center (academic) to dicuss about our collaboration in data collection platform and discussing about the our AI models an challenges we faced lately. Apart from loving to do research myself, I also take satisfaction from facilitating research and bringing the right people together, who then go off and do great things. It last until 12am.


After lunch I try to fcous and do some development. During this time I mostly spend improve the prediction of our cardiovascular risk model. I have a large obsession to improve our models to maximum possible. Usually, one early morning idea, would take several days of implementing and testing.


## My 3 main reasons for this personal; blog and website:
<ol><li>  Practice my writing skills, in general I think more than I do, and I write much less about what I do.
</li><li> Gather all my notes and project in one place to be able to share it with friends and even for myself being able to have access to my notes from anywhere is great.
</li><li> Share my professional experience with a larger group of people.
