I am just following Mike Dane's tutorial.
It is a really really great tutorial!

My two cents tips would be:
1.  Do not give up! What is not understood might be explained later.
2.  Do not mess with GitHub Page until the end of this tutorial.
3.  This is a Jekyll tutorial. It will not cover in details the problems of installing Jekyll, Gems, Bundler, mismatched Versions, and sometimes... antivirus interference!
4.  Neither will it cover the problems of minima theme on GitHub Page. 

Last, it is a free tutorial using free software. BUT, you will need a lot of FREE time!
Thank you Mike, may Jekyll be with you!
