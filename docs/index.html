<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>

My 3 main reasons for this personal; blog and website:
<ol><li>  Practice my writing skills, in general I think more than I do, and I write much less about what I do.
</li><li> Gather all my notes and project in one place to be able to share it with friends and even for myself being able to have access to my notes from anywhere is great.
</li><li> Share my professional experience with a larger group of people.
</li></ol>
Last, it is a <b>free</b> tutorial using <b>free</b> software. 
<b>BUT</b>, you will need a lot of <b>FREE</b> time!
