I have to say I have never used ANOVA, but studied at University like everyone. A friend recoomended [this](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-33/issue-1/Analysis-of-variancewhy-it-is-more-important-than-ever/10.1214/009053604000001048.full) paper.

The paper starts like this: " Is ANOVA obsolete? What is the analysis of variance? Econometricians
see it as an uninteresting special case of linear regression. Bayesians see it
as an inflexible classical method. Theoretical statisticians have supplied many
mathematical definitions [see, e.g., Speed (1987)]. Instructors see it as one of
the hardest topics in classical statistics to teach, especially in its more elaborate
forms such as split-plot analysis. We believe, however, that the ideas of ANOVA
are useful in many applications of statistics. "

I didn't understand why it is one of the hardest topics in classical statistics. As usual, I think an example can be a good start. 


Imagine a scientist wants to study the impact of growth of a plant from the level of exposure to sunlight. so they conduct a one-way ANOVA using level of sunlight exposure as the factor and plant growth as the response. Also imagine she wants to see also watering frequenct as an additional factor so she needs a two-way ANOVA to see if either factor significantly impacts plant growth and whether or not the two factors are related to each other. The results of the ANOVA will will obtain the information whether each factor has a significant effect on plant growth. Using this information, she can better understand which level of sunlight exposure and/or watering frequency leads to optimal growth.
