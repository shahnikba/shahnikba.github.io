I was thinking today why people sometimes they do something that they know it will deliver pain, in workplace and the society.  It seems very irrational to me, while I was searching about it, I came across this book
The Psychology of Extremism A Motivational Perspective. Well, first it was  a little surprise, as the subject of the book as one can imagine must be about religious exterimism or racial supremacist xomes to minds. It turns out this sort of behavioural traits are related to "irrational miswanting" the term I learned from the book. I am not a psychologists, but I read some books and I know some famous people, especially Daniel Kahneman because of his contribution to Economics and I recently read a book from Michele J. Gelfand on Middle east as I am original from there. While, skimming the book, I noticed the refferences to famous people I knew with my very limited knowledge on psychology.  I bought the book, and read it, first chapter is about irrational miswanting. An interesting example of  ‘irrational miswanting’, namely ‘wanting’ something that is correctly remembered and predicted to be painful, was recently demonstrated in a laboratory using optogenetic brain stimulation techniques in rats to make them seek out and touch an object that delivers electric shocks.
