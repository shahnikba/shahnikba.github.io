The project aims at to design and train a neural network with the sole purpose of beating common chess engines that are based only on simple evaluation functions. The common chess engines are great in tactical positions where variations can be calculated out. Their weakness is in vague positional games, where it is not obvious what is going on. Therefore, finding a rich evaluation function can be a game changer.
